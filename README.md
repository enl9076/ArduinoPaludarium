# arduPaludarium
The purpose of this project is to creat a fully automated paludarium in which my anoles and fish can thrive even when I am not home to monitor things. I am using Arduino Uno along with a variety of sensors. See the table below for specififications. 

Variable    |  Type     |  Device
------------|-----------|--------------
temperature |  INPUT    |  DHT11
humidity    |  INPUT    |  DHT11
UV %        |  INPUT    |  [uv sensor]
pump        |  OUTPUT   |  mini 5V DC water pump (connected to relay)
heatLamp    |  OUTPUT   |  ceramic heat lamp (connected to relay)
